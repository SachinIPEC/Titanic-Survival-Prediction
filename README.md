# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **Logistic Regression model** to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

---

## 🔎 Overview

* Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset.
* Clean missing and irrelevant data.
* Perform insightful visualizations.
* Build a predictive Logistic Regression model.
* Evaluate model accuracy and metrics.

## 🧐 Key Insights

* **Women** had a much higher survival rate than men.
* **1st class** passengers had a better chance of survival.
* **Children** and younger passengers survived more often.
* Embarkation port **Cherbourg** had higher survival rate.

## 📈 Future Work

* Try ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
* Hyperparameter tuning.
* Feature engineering (like Family Size).
* Outlier detection and scaling.
